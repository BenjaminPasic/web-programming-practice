Three layers : Data Access Layer, Business Logic Layer and Presentation Layer

Database <- Dao layer <- Business Logic Layer <- Presentation layer.

Presentation layer can only contain FlightPHP syntax, all database request should be handled in the business logic layer.

Business Logic Layer for example is used to check if data is correctly formated, or if it's missing crucial information
before inserting into database.
